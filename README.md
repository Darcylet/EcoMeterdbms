# EcoMeter

## I. Project Overview

EcoMeter is a software application designed to help households track and analyze their energy consumption. It provides insights into daily energy usage, helping users identify areas to reduce consumption and save on energy costs. With a user-friendly interface, EcoMeter empowers families to make smarter, more energy-efficient choices.

## II. Application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles

EcoMeter was built with OOP principles to ensure scalability, modularity, and maintainability. Below are the core OOP principles applied:

- **Encapsulation:**  
  Key functionalities, such as energy data processing and analytics, are encapsulated within classes, ensuring that data integrity is maintained and only relevant methods have access to sensitive data.

- **Inheritance:**  
  The project employs inheritance to create specialized classes for different appliance types that inherit common functionality from a base `Appliances` class.

- **Polymorphism:**  
  Methods such as `displayTip()` are overridden in derived classes to provide tailored calculations based on the tip.

- **Abstraction:**  
  Core functionalities like data retrieval, energy usage calculation, and reporting are abstracted to simplify complex operations, allowing users to interact seamlessly with the application.

## Database Principles

- **Database Normalization:**  
  The database follows normalization principles to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity. Tables are structured to store energy usage, appliance types, and user data in an efficient, scalable manner, improving query performance and maintaining consistency.

## III. Chosen Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) and Its Integration

EcoMeter aligns with **SDG 13: Climate Action**. The application supports this goal by:

- Encouraging households to reduce their energy consumption, thereby lowering their carbon footprint.
- Providing actionable insights based on household energy usage to foster sustainable practices.
- Raising awareness about the environmental impact of excessive energy consumption and promoting behavior changes to mitigate climate change.
